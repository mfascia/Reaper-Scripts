A Collection of useful little scripts for Reaper DAW that help accelerate my workflow.

* PlayRate
  * Presets to slow down playback to 50%, 70%, 80%, 90% or back to 100%. Useful when practicing parts and transcribing.

* Prefix
  * The idea is to mark tracks with a prefix (default: "##") in order to then easily select the marked tracks, mainly to then render them (stems, etc).
  * Suported actions:
    * Add prefix to selected tracks
    * Toggle prefix on selected tracks
    * Remove prefix from selected tracks
    * Remove prefix from all tracks
    * Select all tracks with prefix

* Take Number display
  * The idea is to display on screen which take is beinng recorded and make sure that the video camera sees that, in order to help match audio with video footage
  * Opens a window that displays
    * The current take number being recorded on the active tracks
    * The list oarmed tracks being recorded
